    "# UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "If, like me, you have already attended a machine learning course, you probably already know this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From their outstandingly descriptive [webpage](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones):\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data Set Information:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Attribute Information:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For each record in the dataset it is provided: \n",
    "> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. \n",
    "> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. \n",
    "> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. \n",
    "> - Its activity label. \n",
    "> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, did you also go dizzy with those transformations applied to the sensor signals? Worry not! I also have no idea what they are talking about, but thing is, it makes no difference in this case, since, **#spoiler alert!#** my model performed very nicely after my decision to disregard that information and work with the features at face value. It seems they were simply necessary transformation to turn the signals into useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I would like to comment though: that 561-feature vector, that is my source of data for machine learning, contains mostly statistical information, like average, curtosis and standard deviation, determined on the single movement measurements. Although it comes as no surprise, I found it quite amusing to realize in practice that something such as a standard deviation is useful to model a behavior!"

    "## My approach\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring public datasets, I enjoy to tackle each one of them from a slightly different perspective. For this example, I decided to explore the [Scikit-Learn Supervised learning models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) one by one, trying to pursuit the best-performing. I used all of those that were proper for classification problems, with their default parameters. Then, I delved into the documentation for the best-performing model, in order to explore and tune its parameters. Felt like learning with no effort!"

    "Evaluating how good an accuracy score is is usually not so straightforward, because we cannot know in advance how the \"best *practical* model ever\" would perform for comparison, even though we certainly aim at 100% of accuracy (the \"best *theoretical* model ever\"). \n",
